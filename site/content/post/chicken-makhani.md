## Directions

**CHICKEN**

In a medium bowl, combine the tandoori masala, ginger, garlic, and yogurt. Whisk until smooth. Add the chicken and allow to marinate for at least 20 minutes and ideally for 12-24 hours, covered in the refrigerator.

**BUTTER CHICKEN SAUCE**

Heat the ghee in a heavy bottom pot over medium heat. Add the onions and sauté until they turn translucent and don’t allow the onions to brown. Add ginger and garlic paste and let cook for 30 seconds, stirring so it doesn’t burn. Add the can of crushed tomatoes along with the chili powder, coriander powder, and cumin powder and continue to cook for 5 minutes, if the mixture starts bubbling rapidly, add about ¼ cup of water and continue to cook.

Remove from heat, add the mixture to a blender and blend until smooth (seriously, puree the crap out of it), you may need to add a couple tablespoons of water to help it blend (up to ¼ cup). Depending on how powerful your blender is, you may want to blend the mixture in two batches. Remember to hold the lid of the blender down with a kitchen towel when blending, to avoid accidents. Rinse out the pot.

**ASSEMBLY**

Heat the oil in pot over medium heat. Add the marinated chicken (discard any excess marinade) and cook until browned and cooked through. Add the butter chicken sauce to the pot and heat everything through. Once it starts to bubble, add the cream and garam masala, and optionally an additional 3-6 tablespoons of ghee (recommended). When the sauce regains a simmer, add the crushed fenugreek leaves. Serve over basmati rice or with naan.
