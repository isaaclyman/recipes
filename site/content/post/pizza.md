_Mainly from Anders's_ [_Pizza Dough Calculator_](https://pizza-dough-calculator.herokuapp.com/calculator?a=thicknessFactor&tf=0.08&dw=0&b=4&shp=round&s=14&w=0&l=0&h=62&yt=ady&y=0.4&st=regular&slt=1.5&br=2&p=none&pa=0&pwa=0&pya=0&pfa=0&pst=0&dh=0&ph=0&stf=0&dd=0&ss=0&sa=0&pwt=0&plt=0&c_g=1&c_kg=0&c_ml=0&c_o=1&c_p=0&c_t=0&c_tb=0&c_c=0&c_d=1&c_pr=2&um=false&o25=1.5&o32=1)_._ 



## The Dough

#### Ingredients:

| Ingredient            | Grams         | Ounces|
| :-------------        | -------------:| -----:|
| Flour*                | 856.03        | 30.20 |
| Water**               | 530.74        | 18.72 |
| Yeast***              | 3.42          |  0.12 |
| Salt                  | 12.84         |  0.45 |
| Olive Oil             | 12.84         |  0.45 |
| Sugar                 | 8.56          |  0.30 |
| Total:                | 1,424.43      | 50.25 |
| Single Ball (4 total) | 356.11        | 12.56 |

You can find and adjust the same values from the calculator linked above.
Kitchen scale is recommended.

*High protein/King Arthur preferred but not necessary.

**Room temperature probably best.

***Active Dry Yeast. Calculator will give you the amount for other types. 

#### Directions:
1. Combine yeast, water, and sugar in one bowl.
2. In a large bowl, mix the rest of the ingredients _except_ olive oil.
3. Pour wet mixture into dry, and mix _only_ until ingredients are incorporated. Don't over mix. Should be doughy and sticky, not dry and bready. 
4. Put in olive oil, and gently mix it in using your hands. 
5. Oil some bowls or round containers with additional olive oil. Divide dough evenly into 4 pieces (kitchen scale useful), roll them rougly into a spherical shape, and plop each of them into their own bowl/container. Cover (lid or plastic wrap) and put in fridge for 24 to 72 hours. The longer time is better, but not required.  
6. When ready, pull them out of fridge, stretch, top, and enjoy! 

## Roasted Flour
I like this better than cornmeal for preventing dough from sticking to pizza peel. 

1. Spread an even layer of flour into a frying pan. 
2. On a mediumish heat, cook the flour and ocassionally shuffle/stir the flour to roast it all evenly. Don't let it smoke.
3. Once a golden-brown color is achieved, promptly removed from heat and put in bowl or container to use later. Roasted flour will store in fridge for a long time without going bad.  

Before stretching dough, sprinkle roasted flour on surface to prevent sticking. Use as much or as little as you need. It tastes great.

## The Cheese
High Fat / Low Moisture mozzarella makes a huge difference. [_Walmart sells it at some stores_](https://grocery.walmart.com/ip/Great-Value-Shredded-Whole-Milk-Low-Moisture-Mozzarella-Cheese-8-oz/368703143?wmlspartner=wlpa&selectedSellerId=0&wl13=5167&adid=2222222242031926486&wmlspartner=wmtlabs&wl0=&wl1=g&wl2=c&wl3=334322877257&wl4=aud-413664919370:pla-546274454136&wl5=9029889&wl6=&wl7=&wl8=&wl9=pla&wl10=120643079&wl11=local&wl12=368703143&wl13=5167&veh=sem_LIA&gclid=CjwKCAiArJjvBRACEiwA-Wiqq6jEQ1DoygVizorVLzvpoMNH8k40fCxJJCMwUUJ7OQ1k5hb6IF_L5hoCXvsQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)_._ This cuts down on grease and builds the flavor. 

## Red Sauce

#### Ingredients:
* Large can of crushed tomatoes. Great Value, Muir Glen, whatever tastes great. Alternatively, you can put a drained can of whole tomatoes in a blender.
* Salt

###### Optional:

* Pepper
* Garlic salt
* Oregano
* Italian Seasoning
* Sugar
* Basil
* Idk, just eyeball it and taste often

#### Directions:

1. Pour crushed tomatoes into bowl
2. Salt it to taste
3. Mix in any spices or herbs that sound good, but it is completely optional. It's great with or without. 

## Chicken Bacon Ranch
#### Ingredients:
* Crispy bacon
* Chicken - canned, boiled, fried, whatever. Shredded/small pieces preferred. 
* Wild Coyote Ranch. BYU Creamery ranch is good too but doesn't seem to cook quite as well (Wild Coyote stays creamy).
* Basil on top

## Cheese Bread (garlic butter) 
#### Ingredients:
* Garlic Powder 
* 2 tbsp+ butter (salted is fine)
* Cheese

#### Directions: 
1. Melt butter in microwave
2. Mix in Garlic Powder to taste, but don't be wimpy about it
3. Brush onto stretched dough
4. Cover in cheese
5. (optional) Add basil 

## Margherita
I'll refer Anders to fix up this part since I've never nailed the recipe. 

#### Ingredients:

* Thinly sliced tomatoes
* _Fresh_ mozzarella, sliced or broken chunks
* Olive Oil
* Basil

#### Directions:
1. Brush dough with olive oil (lightly)
2. (optional) pre-cook dough for a minute or two to prevent it from getting soggy from the tomatoes
3. Top, then finish baking

## BBQ Pizza
#### Ingredients:
* Crispy bacon
* Shredded chicken, or however you like it 
* Your favorite BBQ sauce

## Pizza Peel and Stone Method
#### Requirements:
1. Wooden and Metal pizza peels (pizza paddles?)
2. Pizza Stone, on mid to lower rack

#### Directions:
0. Preheat oven _an hour_ ahead of time at 550ºF with the stone inside. It takes awhile to absorb the heat. Longer is better! 
1. Evenly dust wooden paddle with roasted flour or cornmeal
2. Stretch dough onto it
3. Top the dough, ocassionally giving the paddle a little side-to-side shake to ensure the dough isn't sticking
4. Slide pizza from paddle onto stone when ready to cook. Might take a gentle shaking motion to slide it off. 
5. Will take 5 to 8 minutes to cook.
6. When the pizza starts to turn golden brown on top, and leopard print on bottom, slide in metal pizza peel to pull it out . Transfer to pizza pan. 
7. Wait a minute, then cut and serve.

## Pan Method
1. Preheat oven to 550ºF. 
2. Stretch dough to edges of pizza pan, then top it. 
3. Cook in oven noramlly, 7 to 12 minutes or more. My guess would be middle rack, but it all depends on the oven. Bottom should cook as evenly as the top. 
4. Cut and serve.
