  This is a partially complete recipe for making Cupbop (the UglyBop) at home.
  "Copycat," if you will, but might as well be the real thing because I'm not
  messing around. I've been researching and tinkering for months now. Decoded
  and written by Porter Lyman.

This is for the UglyBop with heat level 4.

## Layers guide:

1. Rice doused with a modified bulgogi sauce
2. Light shredded lettuce with very finely shredded purple cabbage (ratio of like 4:1)
3. Sweet Potato Noodles (AKA japchae, or glass noodles)
4. Korean fried chicken (AKA mochiko chicken, although modified). Can also do pork or beef.
5. Black and white sesame seeds, spicy mayo, and white lime sauce. 

Be generous with all sauces. Douse the rice well, but not so much it puddles at the bottom. For the top two sauces, put more than you think you would from the picture. Cupbop's sauces make the dish. 

Note: below a level 4 has less spicy mayo. Above has more. Higher levels have more sriracha and potentially sambal oelek sauce. 

## Making the sauces

![Containers with sauces in them](/img/img_20201027_185247.jpg "Nice little bottles like these are perfect, especially if you don't lose the lids. ")

I highly recommend going to Cupbop and ordering extra sauce with your dish, but in small containers on the side. They're happy to do it. I paid a buck for any sauce on the side. 

**White Lime Sauce**

* 10 Tbsp Mayonnaise
* 4 Tbsp Lime juice
* 8 Tbsp Confectioners/Powdered sugar (or corn based sugar, like corn syrup, if you have it)

I've compared this with their official sauce. With minor variation it's spot on. Their white sauce has a gentle yellow hue to it, so I'm certain they use corn syrup instead. With powdered sugar though you can get pretty close. Just mix the ingredients (double or triple the recipe if needed), and if it's too tart, add more sugar. If it's too sweet, add lime. If it tastes too much like mayo, add the other two ingredients. You get the idea. It should be a generously sweet sauce. 

Feel free to double the recipe, but this should be plenty for a few people.

**Spicy Mayo**

* 1/2 cup mayonnaise
* 6 tsp Sriracha hot sauce
* 1/4 tsp garlic powder
* 1 tsp lime juice

There's room for play here. If it's too spicy, add mayo. If there's not enough kick, add sriracha. Keep in mind this sauce it meant to be applied heavily, and you'll be putting a lot of it on the final dish. Basically, it shouldn't be very spicy unless you're really into that.

Also, feel free to double or triple the recipe, but this should be enough for 2-4 people. 

**Bulgogi Sauce**

I recommend making this vs buying it. I bought some from an Asian store, and the flavor profile isn't quite the same. It's way too strong in flavor. Cupbop has more of an Americanized version that's sweeter and less overwhelming with the other flavors. The basic ingredients are soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic (crushed), grated ginger, sesame oil, and apple or pear or pineapple juice (weird I know). 

Here's what I've done: 

* 3/4 cup soy sauce
* 3/4 cup apple juice
* 3/4 cup brown sugar
* 5/8 tsp garlic powder
* 1/2 tsp black pepper
* (optional) 1 inch of grated ginger, or a tsp. Probably less. I found I didn't have ginger when I made this, and since then I haven't bothered to add it and it's great. Ginger in an authentic quantity is kryptonite, so if you decide to try it, start with a small amount. 

**About Teriyaki Sauce, and why it's not it**

* You _can_ use Teriyaki sauce instead of Bulgogi sauce (many of the ingredients of the sauce overlap), but I really don't recommend it. The problem is that the flavor doesn't necessarily mix as well with the other sauces. It's too gingery. You may be disappointed if you go with it. 
* The real Cupbop bulgogi sauce is somewhere between authentic bulgogi and teriyaki, but with much less ginger and soy sauce (plus sodium). The recipe above is a much better representation of the actual sauce. 

**Mochiko Chicken** 

![Extra crispy Mochiko chicken](/img/img_20201027_185200.jpg "Mochiko chicken with extra mochiko flour as to crisp it up")

Do not use tempura batter! Flavor didn't fit at all. Your standard flour/panko/egg mix isn't quite it either. Instead, try something like [this](https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/91499/general-tsaos-chicken-ii/). Or you can try being authentic:

* 1/4 cup mochiko flour (Japanese sweet rice flour)
  . Do not use real flour. 
* 1/4 cup cornstarch 
* 1/4 cup sugar 
* 5 tablespoons milk (or buttermilk, or technically water). Original recipe asks for soy sauce instead, but Cupbop's isn't quite as flavorful. If you want more chicken flavor, definitely go with the soy sauce. _Marinating here is meant to tenderize more than add flavor, but the green onions and bit of sweetness are nice._ 
* 2 eggs 
* 1/4 cup finely chopped green onions, reserve some for garnish. Optional, I skip this one.  
* 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs
* Oil, for frying
* Salt for taste

1. Cube your chicken into cupbop size. 
2. Mix the first six listed ingredients then put in a sealable bowl or gallon ziplock bag. Stick the cubed chicken in there, and let sit overnight in the fridge, or at least for a few hours.
3. When ready, preheat your oil in a high-walled pan or pot to 350°F.
4. Add extra mochiko flour to a bowl, and coat each piece of chicken in it. This will make it crispy and crunchy after cooking. 
5. Cook a handful of your chicken cubes at a time, flipping partway through (unless completely submerged), until internal temperature of the chicken is above 165°. The mochiko flour exterior doesn't brown much, but you can brown the flayed edges a little. 
6. After transferring your chicken to a cooling rack (or plate covered with a double layer of paper towels), _salt it!_ The chicken needs salt, and this seems to be the tastiest place to add it. If you want instead, you can experiment by adding it to the marinade or at another stage in the process.

**For other meats**

I haven't tried pork or beef yet, but I'd suggest cooking in whatever way you know best, and consider making a bulgogi marinade (with reduced soy sauce and ginger) to use in the process. 

## **Other Ingredients**

* Shredded lettuce
* Thinly shredded cabbage
* Sweet potato noodles (one typical bag makes enough for three people). Basically you boil it for 6 minutes, then rinse with cold water.
* Cooked white rice. Whatever brand or method you prefer. 
* Black and white sesame seeds to garnish

And of course, you'll also need your sauces and your meat of choice from above.

**Make the thing!**

Refer to my layers guide at the top. Rice and meat should be served hot. Enjoy!

**_Tips_**

I use metal salad tongs to transfer chicken to and from the oil, and am able to fry without ever touching the chicken.

When frying, use a high walled pot. This will prevent splashes.

After frying, let the oil cool over night then strain into your oil container (or new container). If you don't have a way to strain it, funnel it in and let it sit. All the extra flakes and brown stuff will separate and clump at the bottom. Either way, you'll be able to reuse your oil for cooking in the future. 

Be generous with all sauces. Douse the rice well, but not so much it puddles at the bottom. For the top two sauces, put more than you think you would from the picture. Cupbop's sauces make the dish. 

If you want to make your dish less sweet (holy smokes there is a ton of sugar in there), there's definitely an opportunity to make the white lime sauce a little more tart (less sugar), and you could skip the sugar in the mochiko chicken mix. I haven't tried the Buglogi sauce with less sugar, but it's worth a shot, right? You could avoid the post meal coma. 

Before creating your sauces, if you're super serious about this, I highly recommend buying the sauces individually from Cupbop and comparing side by side when you're creating from scratch. The only one I haven't done this with yet is the Bulgogi, but my instructions are pretty close, and pretty tasty. 

Last of all, and most importantly, support Cupbop! Buy their food often, single-handedly keep them in business. I do, and when we can't make the long drive up to Orem (the best location), we make it at home.

If you're curious about the sweet potato "glass" noodles, here's what they look like:

![Sweet potato "glass" noodles](/img/img_20201027_185213.jpg "Sweet potato \"glass\" noodles")

I wouldn't substitute them for anything. _Maybe_ rice noodles, but I wouldn't.
